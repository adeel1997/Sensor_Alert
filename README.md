# Sensor Alert & Performance (SAP) for PurpleAir IoT sensors

An open source code that helps to create a Sensor Alert & Performance (SAP) system for the low cost IoT purple air sensors (https://www2.purpleair.com/). PurpleAir makes inexpensive air pollution sensors to track PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5 means "Particulate Matter 2.5 Micron," which is small particles that enters our human body while breathing from vairous sources.

#### What is Inside the SAP? 
1. <filename> - A webpage to overview all low costs sensors, their perfromance metrics, exploratory analysis via sactter & box plots across states , districts and also locate them on the map. 
2. <filename> - Sending SMS via Twilio application to notify particular inactive sensor unit(s) based on last active time & report to the concerned hosts in near real-time.
3. <filename> - Sending messages via Slack application to notify particular inactive sensor unit(s) based on last active time & report high PM2.5 levels to the concerned hosts in near real-time as part of alert system.
